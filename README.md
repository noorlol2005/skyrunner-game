# SkyRunner Game 🏎️🌇🌆🌃

SkyRunner is a game we made in JavaFX. Set in a futurustic Dubai the game evolves around the player contorlling their own flying car and as time passes, score icnreases and score leads to coins which are used to unlock new cars. If the player colides with any of the game-controlled cars (the only obstacles in the game) the game ends.
